# Webstorm Setup

After downloading Webstorm, to get it configured with the familiar plugins, keybindings and config do the following:

* File -> Manage IDE Settings -> Import Settings -> ~/<PATH_TO_THIS_REPO>/webstorm/Settings.zip

* DO NOT SETUP ACCOUNT SETTING SYNC WITH WEBSTORM - this will cause headaches and will damage setup on other devices using Webstorm with the same license and has yet to be proven as successful
